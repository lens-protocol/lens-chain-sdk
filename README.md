## Development Workflow

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the SDK.

### Pre-requisites: <!-- omit in toc -->

- Node.js: >= v20. See [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
- pnpm: v9.1.2. See [installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions, you can run:

```bash
nvm use
```

to switch to the correct Node.js version.

We recommend to have [corepack](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-use-corepack) enabled to automatically have the correct version of `pnpm`.

PRIVATE_KEY=0xâ€¦
```

with the private key of a test EOA.
